# Süisse Music Web Design Project.

## Website Overview:

This project was created using the skills learned so far in the course to develop a mobile first responsive website for the house music DJ and producer Süisse.
It allows fans to view videos, look at pictures and listen to the latest tracks and playlists created by Süisse.
If they like what they see they can enquire about booking him via the Contact me section. 

## Website Functionality:

The website is fully functional on both mobile,larger screens and desktop.
There is additional content for larger screens (4 x images in the picture section).
The navigation bar is functional on both mobile and larger screens, using a compressed version of the navigation bar on mobile devices. 
There is also a contact me enquiry form which allows user to input there details to request further information or to make a booking. 
This form is not fully functional as it doesnt send details to a database or inform any site admins that a form has been filled in. 

## User Design Experience:
To see My user design experience view the content of the user design experience folder where i have section for strategy, skeleton,scope and structure. 
## Technologies used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* Bash
* GITHUB
* GIT
* Google chrome development tools
* Google Fonts
* Fontawesome 
* Javascript and JQuery are ued for the enquire here modal
* Webstorm IDE

## Deployment:

The website was coded using webstorm IDE ,I used a local GIT repository for version control, I then committed it to the gtthub repository and then pushed it to GITHUB, I did this numerous times over the project when I completed certain areas or fixed certain issues.
 Once in the GITHUB repository the site was made live using GITHUB pages and can be found here: https://cthoms1993.github.io/Suisse-music-/

## Testing:

The site was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome development tools.
It was tested on landscape and portrait mode on Google pixel 2, Google pixel 3, Galaxy S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop.
All social media links, videos, music players  and the enquire now modal where tested locally and remotely.
For future improvement it would be good to have the navigation bar auto-collapse when in mobile view. 

## Credits:

I used the modal previously used in the whisky drop website for my enquire to book me section, however I have altered the code and the content to reflect the purpose of the modal in my web page.
